# Flower-Image-Classifier
This project is a deep learning-based image classifier that predicts the category of a flower from an uploaded image. here I trained a CNN with TensorFlow and Keras to recognizethe type of flower. It demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to real-world image classification tasks.
